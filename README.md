# Ground Truthing GPT3.5
Repository to hold the code for our UMICH SIADS Master of Applied Data Science Capstone project, with a focus on fact checking OpenAI's GPT-3.

## Setup
1. Git clone this repository
2. Create a new Python or Anaconda environment for this project
3. ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 

Will install:
- **Pandas** (Operate on tabular data)
- **TQDM** (prints progress bars)
- **Wikidata** (structured queries to Wikidata; punches under it's weight, we're also firing off SparQL queries with the Python `Requests` built-in package)
- **OpenAI** (GPT-3 interface, among other things)
- **Seaborn** (Visualization Package)
- **Plotly** (Visualization Package)
- **python-dotenv** (Secrets management)
- Specific versions of Python 3 Built-ins (Requests, matplotlib)

## Running the code
Open the Notebooks folder, and step through the numbered notebooks. The notebooks are numbered because certain stages build upon data retrieved in earlier stages, with exploratory data analysis (EDA) separated from long-running data gathering code.
